issueNumber: MDL-87451
notes:
  core_reportbuilder:
    - message: >-
        The following methods now support both string or entity instance types
        for parameters referring to entities by name, which prevents lookups of
        instances which most report sources will already have:


        - `add_all_from_[entity|entities]()`

        - `add_[columns|filters|conditions]_from_entity()`
      type: changed
